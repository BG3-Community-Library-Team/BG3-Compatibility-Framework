This is the Compatibility Framework. Split off from BG3 Community Library, this mod provides an API for other mods to use improve compatibility. Initially designed for Subclass Compatibility, the Framework has API endpoints that Script-Extender Enabled mods can hook into to insert values into Progressions and Spell/Skill/PassiveLists at Runtime. What this means is that a mod author can inject their mod's data into existing Progressions or Lists without overwriting data, allowing for total compatibility.

The Compatibility Framework makes it easy to set your mods up for compatibility with other mods, just by utilizing the Framework's API.

## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possibly Vortex and Manual
Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
