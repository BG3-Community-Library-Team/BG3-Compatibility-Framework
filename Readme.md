[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework?label=Latest%20Version)](https://GitHub.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/releases/) [![GitHub commits](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/2.0.0/main)](https://GitHub.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/commit/)

This is the Subclass Compatibility Framework. Split off from BG3 Community Library, this mod aims to patch subclass mods created by the community, using a Community Submission approach. All compatibility patches set up in the Community Library have been moved to this library, and future requests to add Subclass Support are meant to come through here. If you want to know which subclasses are currently supported, [check out this list](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/wiki/Supported-Mods).

## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possibly Vortex and Manual
Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
